# Projects

Here is a list of the Projects that I have undertaken.


##JavaScript 30

This is part of the [Javascript 30](https://javascript30.com/)  series of  small Javascript projects to help develop a better understanding of JS on the web.


### CSS Variables in JS

This single page site takes the interactions of the user by using the slider to change the CSS properties of the picture element.

### Custom Video Player

This page took a mind of its own. 
Here we are creating our own custom video player overlay on top of the browsers video player. 
I managed to find a link to an old Popeye video, that is what kicked off the Popeye themed page.

### Drum Kit

I am a drummer, and I particularly enjoyed this project. Building a drum machine would of felt like a complex task. But the project set out a very straight forward approach to the task.
